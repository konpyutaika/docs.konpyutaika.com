The [new dbt Certification Program](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-certification-program) has been created by dbt Labs to codify the data development best practices that enable safe, confident, and impactful use of dbt. Taking the Certification allows dbt users to get recognized for the skills theyâ€™ve honed, and stand out to organizations seeking dbt expertise.

Over the last few months, [Montreal Analytics](https://www.montrealanalytics.com/), a full-stack data consultancy servicing organizations across North America, has had over 25 dbt Analytics Engineers become certified, earning them the 2022 dbt Platinum Certification award.

In this article, two Montreal Analytics consultants, Jade and Callie, discuss their experience in taking, and passing, the dbt Certification exam to help guide others looking to study for, and pass the exam.
